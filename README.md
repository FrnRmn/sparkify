### Motivation
The current work is a project proposed by Udacity to familiarize with Pyspark.

In this notebook I analyze a synthetic dataset containing a log of user interactions with a music application.
The goal is to clean and explore data, select promising features and fit a model to predict which users have the activity profile suggesting an imminent subscription cancellation.


### Files Description
- mini_sparkify_event_data.json: synthetic dataset
- main.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing the analysis
